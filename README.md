### Food Byte CS 411 Project

To tool around with the app directly, here's a quickstart guide.

Clone this repo to your local machine.

Now install the required modules:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To play with the app right away, you can use a local database. Edit ```config.py``` by commenting out the AWS URL and uncomment this line:
```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///test.db'
```
Next run:
```
$ python db_create.py
```
And the tables are created.  Now you can launch the app:
```
$ python application.py
```
And point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:5000

Using the top form, you can write to the database:
